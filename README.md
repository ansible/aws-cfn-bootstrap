# aws-cfn-bootstrap

Download source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html
Which resolves to: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/aws-cfn-bootstrap-py3-latest.tar.gz  
Untarring the code gives the directory name `aws-cfn-bootstrap-2.0`, but that's a terrible repo name - so the `2.0` got removed
